# Welcome Back!
Hello! Welcome to your second lesson! Hopefully you found the tutorial from the first one great (and scored some good points). Now, we are going to start our transition to CSS. Don't worry! The HTML development lessons will only focus on HTML and the CSS Lessons will only focus on CSS, so if you are better at HTML (like me), then stick with the HTML, but still dabble in CSS as it's still really important. Now, what is CSS?
# What is CSS?
CSS is also known as Cascading Style Sheets. Don't worry too much about the name. CSS's primary use is to make websites look good. CSS is how you add color and style to a website.
# How to use CSS?
CSS can be implemented in many different ways. The first being added to the actual tag it's self. Remember when we talked about 'special tags'? There's another one where you add style="" inside. This can be useful if you just want to add CSS to one object.
