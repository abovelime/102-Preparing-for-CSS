# Welcome Back!
Hello! Welcome to your second lesson! Hopefully you found the tutorial from the first one great (and scored some good points). Now, we are going to start our transition to CSS. Don't worry! The HTML development lessons will only focus on HTML and the CSS Lessons will only focus on CSS, so if you are better at HTML (like me), then stick with the HTML, but still dabble in CSS as it's still really important. Now, what is CSS?
# What is CSS?
CSS is also known as Cascading Style Sheets. Don't worry too much about the name. CSS's primary use is to make websites look good. CSS is how you add color and style to a website.
# How to use CSS?
CSS can be implemented in many different ways. The first being added to the actual tag it's self. Remember when we talked about 'special tags'? There's another one where you add style="" inside. This can be useful if you just want to add CSS to one object. Check ExampleST.html to see what that looks like. The second way is to add a style tag inside the head tag where you put your tab title inside. Check ExampleTT.html to see what this one looks like. Final one is to link another CSS Document. This is used for having multiple pages that share the same design or to hide it from people visiting your website. This one is the most popular. Check ExampleLS.html to see what this one looks like.
# Your Work
You won't have to add anything to the CSS tags or special tags until the CSS lesson. For this lesson though,

Fork this repository. Then, You need to follow the instructions in assignment.html and do what they say. 

To get top marks, do them correctly.
